## ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL RULES - NEVER IGNORE!

### RULE 1: NEVER use Unicode/Emojis in code

- NEVER write Unicode characters like ðŸ”§ in Go code
- REASON: Destroys files and build processes
- ONLY use ASCII characters in all code files

### RULE 2: NEVER manually modify generated files

- NEVER: directly edit generated/templates/registry.go
- NEVER: directly edit *_templ.go files
- REASON: They are overwritten with every build
- CORRECT: Modify generator templates in cmd/template-generator/

### RULE 3: Pay attention to template generator paths

- Generator is in cmd/trgen/
- Install: go install github.com/denkhaus/templ-router/cmd/trgen@main
- Execution: trgen ...

### RULE 4: NEVER replace production code with dummies

- This is a PRODUCTION PROJECT, not a test example
- Adapt real implementations for DI, don't replace them

### RULE 5: Dependency Injection Container rules

- ONLY provider registrations in the container
- NO logic in the container

### RULE 6: ALWAYS use expand_code_chunks first

- NEVER blindly find_and_replace without seeing the current code
- ALWAYS look at the code with expand_code_chunks first

### RULE 7: Use knot CLI for work structuring

- ALWAYS use the knot CLI to structure work
- Create issues for complex tasks and problems
- Clearly define and track next steps
- knot is a valuable tool for systematic work
- Example: `knot task create --title "Implement Template Generator Version System" --description "Add up to 2000 characters to give the task a comprehensive description"`
- Don't create Markdown files unless it's explicitly the purpose of the task, instead create new projects, tasks and subtasks with knot

THESE RULES ARE BASED ON REAL ERRORS - NEVER IGNORE!

## KNOT CLI SYSTEM - CRITICAL LEARNINGS

### NEVER MECHANICALLY PROCESS TASKS!

WRONG PATTERN (I did this and it was terrible):

```bash
knot actionable
knot task update-state --id <id> --state in-progress
knot task update-state --id <id> --state completed  # NO WORK DONE!
knot actionable
# Repeat...
```

RIGHT PATTERN:

1. `knot actionable` - Find next task
2. ANALYZE the task description thoroughly
3. `knot task update-state --id <id> --state in-progress`
4. DO THE ACTUAL WORK (code changes, analysis, documentation)
5. ONLY THEN: `knot task update-state --id <id> --state completed`

### KNOT SYSTEM CAPABILITIES (More advanced than I thought!)

Task Management:

- `knot task update-title/description/priority` - Update task details
- `knot task bulk-update/bulk-create/bulk-delete` - Bulk operations
- `knot task tree` - Hierarchical view
- `knot task children/parent/roots` - Navigation

Dependencies:

- `knot dependency chain` - Show dependency paths
- `knot dependency cycles` - Detect circular dependencies
- `knot dependency validate` - Validate all dependencies

Templates:

- `knot template list/apply` - Standardized workflows
- Templates with variables for customization

Validation:

- `knot validate states/transition/project` - State validation
- Prevents invalid state transitions

Project Analytics:

- `knot ready/blocked/actionable` - Smart task selection
- `knot breakdown` - Find complex tasks needing breakdown

### CRITICAL MISTAKES TO AVOID:

1. Never mark tasks completed without doing actual work
2. Always understand task description before starting
3. Use the rich feature set - don't reinvent existing functionality

### BEST PRACTICES:

1. Always start with: `knot get-started` to understand capabilities
2. Use templates for recurring work patterns
3. Break down complex tasks (complexity >= 8)
4. Set dependencies to ensure proper work order
5. Validate project state regularly with `knot validate project`

KNOT is a professional-grade tool - treat it with respect!
