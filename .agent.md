## ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL RULES - NEVER IGNORE!

### RULE 1: NEVER use Unicode/Emojis in code

- NEVER write Unicode characters like ðŸ”§ in Go code
- REASON: Destroys files and build processes
- ONLY use ASCII characters in all code files

### RULE 2: NEVER manually modify generated files

- NEVER: directly edit generated/templates/registry.go
- NEVER: directly edit \*\_templ.go files
- REASON: They are overwritten with every build
- CORRECT: Modify generator templates in cmd/template-generator/

### RULE 3: Pay attention to template generator paths

- Generator is in cmd/trgen/
- Install: go install github.com/denkhaus/templ-router/cmd/trgen@main
- Execution: trgen ...

### RULE 4: NEVER replace production code with dummies

- This is a PRODUCTION PROJECT, not a test example
- Adapt real implementations for DI, don't replace them

### RULE 5: Dependency Injection Container rules

- ONLY provider registrations in the container
- NO logic in the container

### RULE 6: ALWAYS use expand_code_chunks first

- NEVER blindly find_and_replace without seeing the current code
- ALWAYS look at the code with expand_code_chunks first

### RULE 7: Use knot CLI for work structuring

- ALWAYS use the knot CLI to structure work
- Create issues for complex tasks and problems
- Clearly define and track next steps
- knot is a valuable tool for systematic work
- Example: `knot task create --title "Implement Template Generator Version System" --description "Add up to 2000 characters to give the task a comprehensive description"`
- Don't create Markdown files unless it's explicitly the purpose of the task, instead create new projects, tasks and subtasks with knot

THESE RULES ARE BASED ON REAL ERRORS - NEVER IGNORE!
